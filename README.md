<p>
A robotic arm with 4 dof is controlled remotely with the help of esp32 webserver which is hosted locally.  
</p>

## What it does
We can control the robotic arm using the sliders and can be used for operations like pick and place. I have also integrated an Rpi with Rpi camera by which we can see the live feed of the camera as well.  

## Webserver UI
Based on these sliders, the robotic arm can be controlled.
